For hundreds of years, learning sheet music has been a key part of learning piano in a traditional European musical education. 

A lot of people have been put off music, or made to feel as though they are not ‘real’ musicians, because they cannot, or will not, read sheet music.

The reality is, sheet music is just a //common// way of recording music. 

That’s all. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>> 
Sheet music is often taught very early in musical education. It's a common practice, and everyone is used to things being done that way. 

But, I’m sure you can think of many aspects of life that also fit that criteria, but which you know aren't 'the only' way of doing things. Like, for example, being right-handed. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>> 
There are far more right-handed people in the world, than there are left-handed people. Thanks to the Catholic Church, in the past, almost all left-handed people in the UK were forced to write with their right hand instead, even though doing this caused all sorts of problems for their brains. This still happens in some schools today! 
<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>> 
Left handed people were less common, and they didn't do things in the same way as everyone else. They were made to feel like this was their own fault, when really, right-handers were just more common. 

How does this have anything to do with sheet music? Well, I wonder how many musicians we've lost, because they didn't, or couldn't, read sheet music. Is sheet music actually essential for being a musician, or is it just a common idea of what a musician should be? 
<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>> 
With that said, let’s take a look at how music can be recorded in a completely different way to European sheet music.

‘Graphic’ scores, or ‘visual’ scores use pictures to get across how the composer wanted their song to be played. Take a look at this little bit of the score for Hannah Kendall's 'The Spark Catchers'. She writes her scores like this before writing them up as sheet music, but, this is still a picture of the music she hears in her head.

<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>> 
It could be anything, right? Well, that’s true, unless you make some decisions about //how// to look at it.

Go back to the black keys that you used to test the piano a little while ago. Have a play with them, and see how they sound. 

Then, look back at the picture. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>> 
Create a set of rules for how these symbols can be played, using the piano. If you choose a rule, and decide you don’t like it, throw it out, and get a new one.
<<linkreplace "Not sure where to start?" t8n>> 
If you’re not sure where to start, how about deciding:
* What direction will you take, across the page, in order to read it? Left to right, like a book, or perhaps top to bottom?
* How could you use the shapes to decide how long each note will be played for?
When you’ve had enough of this, take a look at the full version…

Here’s another section of Hannah Kendall's score. 

<img src="img/hkendall.png" width="95%">

Remember the rules that you decided on in the previous section, and think about which parts of the image need some more rules, so that you can play it.
<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>> 
* What do the diamonds mean?
* What does the shading on the right-hand side mean?
* What are the scratchy blue pen marks for?

Try to play through all of the score, then bring the piece to a close.
