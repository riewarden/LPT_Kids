@@.spButton;For hundreds of years, learning sheet music has been a key part of learning piano in a traditional European musical education. 

A lot of people have been put off music, or made to feel as though they are not ‘real’ musicians, because they cannot, or will not, read sheet music.

The reality is, sheet music is just a //common// way of recording music. 

That’s all. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>> 
It’s familiar to lot of people, and it’s an old tradition. But, I’m sure you can think of many aspects of life that also fit that criteria, but which you know aren't 'the only' way of doing things. Like, for example, Christmas. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>> 
Christmas isn’t immoral to participate in, by any means. However, when a society gives lots of space to Christmas, and no space for non-Christian celebrations, or, if people are made to feel guilty for not celebrating Christmas... This makes Christmas harmful. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>> 
Christmas can eclipse other ways of celebrating. How does sheet music do the same thing for music? How many musicians have we lost, who were told off by the teacher, because they didn’t read sheet music?
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>> 
With that said, let’s take a look at how music can be recorded in a completely different way to European sheet music.

It could be anything, right? Well, that’s true, unless you make some decisions about //how// to look at it.

Go back to the black keys that you used to test the piano a little while ago. Have a play with them, and see how they sound. 
Then, look back at the picture. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>> 
Create a set of rules for how these symbols can be played, using the piano. If you choose a rule, and decide you don’t like it, throw it out, and get a new one.
<<linkreplace "Not sure where to start?" t8n>> 
If you’re not sure where to start, how about deciding:
* How do the shapes tell you the length of each note?
* Then, how do the colours change the notes again?

Keeping in mind a few of the rules you came up with for yourself, are there any other ways to play these notes that might be hard to describe, without pictures? 
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>> 
*Which parts are the same? 
*Which parts are different? 
*Which parts are the most difficult to interpret? 
*How would you change it?
