For hundreds of years, learning sheet music has been a key part of learning piano in a traditional European musical education. 

A lot of people have been put off music, or made to feel as though they are not ‘real’ musicians, because they cannot, or will not, read sheet music.

The reality is, sheet music is just a //common// way of recording music. 

That’s all. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>> 
It’s familiar to lot of people, and it’s an old tradition. But, I’m sure you can think of many aspects of life that also fit that criteria, but which you know aren't 'the only' way of doing things. Like, for example, Christmas. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>> 
Christmas isn’t immoral to participate in, by any means. However, when a society gives lots of space to Christmas, and no space for non-Christian celebrations, or, if people are made to feel guilty for not celebrating Christmas... This makes Christmas harmful. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>> 
Christmas can eclipse other ways of celebrating. How does sheet music do the same thing for music? How many musicians have we lost, who were told off by the teacher, because they didn’t read sheet music?
<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>> 
With that said, let’s take a look at how music can be recorded in a completely different way to European sheet music.

‘Graphic’ scores, or ‘visual’ scores use pictures to get across how the composer wanted their song to be played. Take a look at this little bit of the score for Hannah Kendall's 'The Spark Catchers'. She writes her scores like this before writing them up as sheet music, but, this is still a picture of the music she hears in her head.

It could be anything, right? Well, that’s true, unless you make some decisions about //how// to look at it.

Go back to the black keys that you used to test the piano a little while ago. Have a play with them, and see how they sound. 

Then, look back at the picture. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>> 
Create a set of rules for how these symbols can be played, using the piano. If you choose a rule, and decide you don’t like it, throw it out, and get a new one.
<<linkreplace "Not sure where to start?" t8n>> 
If you’re not sure where to start, how about deciding:
* What direction will you take, across the page, in order to read it? Left to right, like a book, or perhaps top to bottom?
* How could you use the shapes to decide how long each note will be played for?

Here’s another section of Hannah Kendall's score.

Remember the rules that you decided on in the previous section, and think about which parts of the image need some more rules, so that you can play it.

Try to play through all of the score, then bring the piece to a close.
