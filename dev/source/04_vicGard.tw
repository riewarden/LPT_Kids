Hello. Welcome to Trinity Gardens! Before we begin, we need to ensure the piano is working. If it is not working, [tap here to contact a member of staff.|sam.berrill@leedspiano.com] please play the following test keys, in any order, to ensure the piano is working.

For hundreds of years, learning sheet music has been a key part of learning piano in a traditional European musical education. A lot of people (the author of this digital content included) have been put off music, or made to feel as though they are not ‘real’ musicians, because they cannot, or will not, read sheet music.

The reality is, sheet music is just a popular way of noting music. That’s all. It’s familiar to lot of people, and it’s an old tradition. I’m sure you can think of many aspects of life that also fit that criteria, and actually don’t work for a lot of people. Like Christmas, for example. Christmas isn’t immoral to participate in, by any means, but when it’s given special privileges over non-Christian celebrations, or if people are made to feel guilty for not wanting to celebrate it, Christmas becomes harmful. 

How many musicians have we lost, who were told off by the teacher, because they didn’t read sheet music?

With that said, let’s take a look at how music has been recorded in a completely different way than European sheet music.

‘Graphic’ scores, or ‘visual’ scores use pictures to get across how the composer wanted their song to be played. Take a look at this little bit of the score for Hannah Kendall's 'The Spark Catchers'.

=img of her score=

It could be anything, right? Well, that’s true, unless you make some decisions.
Go back to the black keys that you used to test the piano a little while ago. Have a play with them, and see how they sound. Then, look back at the picture. Try to come up with a few of your own rules for how these symbols relate to each other, and can be played, using the piano. If you choose a rule, and decide you don’t like it, throw it out, and get a new one.

If you’re not sure where to start, how about deciding:
- option 1
- option 2

When you’ve had enough of this, take a look at the full version…

Here’s another section of Hannah Kendall's score. Keeping in mind a few of the rules you came up with for yourself, are there any other ways to play these notes that might be hard to describe, without pictures? 

Try to play through all of this section. Which parts are the same? Which parts are different? Which parts are the most difficult to interpret? How would you change it?
