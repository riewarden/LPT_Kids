!Welcome to Mandela Gardens. 
These gardens were dedicated to Nelson Mandela, in solidarity with his campaign against apartheid in South Africa. People came together here, to celebrate, when he became South Africa’s first Black president in 1994.

There are three pianos in the area. 

!!If you came here by yourself...
Go to the piano on the plinth, which overlooks the other two.

!!If you’re here with a friend...
Get them to scan the QR code on their device, (or, just shout the instructions to them, across the square). Then, set yourselves up on the pianos that are facing each other, and follow the instructions together.

Before we do anything, however, we need to ensure the piano is working. Please play the following test keys, in any order, a few times over. 

All of the keyboard diagrams start with C. This is the flat, white key just before any two raised black keys. The white keys that follow C progress alphabetically until G, then start again from A.

!What is Jazz music?
Jazz music has a rich and complex history, rooted in the people of African Diaspora communities, who were trafficked, primarily by white people, and brought to the West during the Transatlantic Slave Trade. Jazz fuses African musical traditions with Western musical traditions. 

One aspect that we’ll look at today, is the idea that Jazz, and music in general, can be like speaking, or having a conversation. In the history of European music, musicians have always tended to write music down, and then have people perform it exactly as it was recorded. In many African countries, however, it's more common for music to spring from the relationship between musicians, their audience, and the context where music is being made. This approach to music, but using European instruments, is how Jazz arose in the West. 

First of all, go back to the test keys. 

<img src="img/CEG_Highlighted.png" width="95%" alt="The keys ‘C,E,G’ are highlighted.">

Use your left hand to play C, E, and G, at the same time. Whenever you play more than one note at the same time, it’s called playing a ‘chord’. Try that, and see how it sounds, in comparison to just playing a note by itself.

Once you’re happy with playing that chord, keep your left hand on it, if possible, and move to the next section.

!Musical Conversations
When we talk to another person, there can often be unspoken rules or conventions that indicate, for example, when one person is finished talking, and another person can begin. There’s no right or wrong way to converse. It will always vary according to culture, family, how much practice we’ve had, etc.

Keep your left hand on the chord, C, E, and G.
Then, put your right hand on the notes highlighted below. Arrange your right hand so that every key highlighted in the diagram has one finger on top of it.

<<linkreplace "Optional: I need help with this.">>
In a different place to your left hand, find two black keys on their own, and put your right-hand thumb on the white key just to the left of them. Then, put the rest of your fingers on the keys that follow it.

Don’t worry, you won’t be asked to play both hands together. Get used to your hands being in this position. Try playing the keys a little to see how this position feels and sounds.

When you're happy with playing C, E, G, in your left hand, and C, D, E, F, G, in your right hand, move on to the next section.

!Think again about comparing music with a conversation. 
In some conversations, people will indicate to their partner that they’ve finished speaking. They might do this by lowering the pitch at the end of a sentence, or asking the other person a question. 

You can apply similar rules like this to music, and this is even known as ‘conversation’, in Jazz music.

Look back at the piano. Make sure your hands are set up like this.

Try playing a few of the notes under your right fingers, just going up and down, and then use the three-note chord, in your left hand, to show when you’ve finished that section. Then, do it again, and again.

Once you’re happy with this as a pattern, move on to the next section.

!Play a duet
If you’ve been following these exercises with another person, you’ll probably have started to see how you can turn this shared set of rules into a duet, without having to read sheet music at all. 

!!Cutting Contests
This style of playing is sometimes called ‘Conversational Jazz’, or ‘Cutting Contests’. Cutting contests involve Jazz musicians testing each other's musical skills, and were common in the Harlem Jazz community in New York, between the 1940s and the 1970s. 

They were also a form of musical education. Competitors had to listen carefully, and respond to their opponent, and the audience reaction, in order to be the most entertaining performer. Musicians like James P. Johnson, Fats Waller, and Art Tatum, often battled it out at cutting contests. 

In Black neighbourhoods, people often held 'Rent Parties', where the community came together, to enjoy music and dancing, stage cutting contests. These parties were also a method for this marginalised community to provide mutual aid for those in need, as the entry fee went towards the rent, for the party hosts.

!Have a conversation, with the pianos
If you’re playing on your own, keep playing your conversation, but imagine you’re providing both parts. How are these two characters interacting? If you’re with a friend, try to have a conversation, or a competition, through your pianos, using no words.

Once you’ve got the hang of that, move on to the last section.

!Breaking the rules
After a while, start to break the rules. What are you not supposed to do in a conversation? Or, how far can you push the rules without the other person retaliating? Apply the rules playfully. How do kids learn to talk?

Find a way to use these techniques to bring the piece to a close. If you’re with a friend, can you end the piece together, without talking about it?
