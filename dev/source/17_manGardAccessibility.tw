!Welcome to The Mandela Gardens. 
These gardens were dedicated to Nelson Mandela, in solidarity with his campaign against apartheid in South Africa. People came together here, to celebrate, when he became South Africa’s first Black president in 1994.

There are three pianos in the area. Are you here by yourself, or do you have company?

If you came here by yourself, go to the piano on the plinth, which overlooks the other two.

If you’re here with a friend, get them to scan the QR code on their device, (or, just shout the instructions to them, across the square).

Then, set yourselves up on the pianos that are facing each other, and follow the instructions together.

Before we do anything, however, we need to ensure the piano is working. Please play the following test keys, in any order, a few times over.

Once you’ve played the test keys a few times, click ‘Next’.

Jazz music has a rich and complex history, rooted in the people of African Diaspora communities, who were captured and brought to the West during the Transatlantic Slave Trade. Jazz fuses African musical traditions with Western musical traditions. 

One aspect that we’ll look at today, is the idea that Jazz, and music in general, can be like speaking, or having a conversation.

First of all, look back at the test keys.

Play the three test keys at the same time. Whenever you play more than one note at the same time, it’s called playing a ‘chord’. Try that, and see how it sounds, in comparison to just playing a note by itself.

Once you’re happy with playing that chord, keep your left hand on it, and tap ‘Next’.

When we talk to another person, there can often be unspoken rules or conventions that indicate, for example, when one person is finished talking, and another person can begin. There’s no right or wrong way to converse. It will always vary according to culture, family, how much practice we’ve had, etc.

Keep your left hand on the chord, the three notes.
Then, put your right hand on the notes highlighted below. Arrange your right hand so that every key highlighted in the picture has one finger on top of it.

Find two black keys on their own, and put your left-hand thumb on the white key just to the left of them. Then, put the rest of your fingers on the keys that follow it.

Don’t worry, you won’t be asked to play both hands together. Get used to your hands being in this position. Try playing the keys a little to see how this position feels and sounds.

When you’re ready to move on, tap ‘Next’.

Think again about comparing music with a conversation. In some conversations, people will indicate to their partner that they’ve finished speaking. They might do this by lowering the pitch at the end of a sentence, or asking the other person a question. 

You can apply similar rules like this to music, and this is even known as ‘conversation’, in Jazz music.

Look back at the piano. Make sure your hands are set up like this.

Try playing a few of the notes under your right fingers, just going up and down, and then use the three-note chord, in your left hand, to show when you’ve finished that section. Then, do it again.

Once you’re happy with this as a pattern, click ‘Next’.

If you’ve been following these exercises with another person, you’ll probably have started to see how you can turn this shared set of rules into a duet, without having to read sheet music at all. 

This style of playing is sometimes called ‘Conversational Jazz’, or ‘Cutting Contests’. Cutting contests involve Jazz musicians testing each other's musical skills, and were common in the Harlem Jazz community in New York, during the 1930s. 

In Black neighbourhoods, people often held 'Rent Parties', where the community came together, to enjoy music and dancing, stage cutting contests, and provide mutual financial aid.

If you’re playing on your own, keep playing your conversation, but imagine you’re providing both parts. How are these two characters interacting? If you’re with a friend, try to have a conversation, or a competition, through your pianos, using no words.

Once you’ve got the hang of that, click ‘Next’

After a while, start to break the rules. What are you not supposed to do in a conversation? Or, how far can you push the rules without the other person retaliating? Apply the rules playfully. How do kids learn to talk?

Find a way to use these techniques to bring the piece to a close. If you’re with a friend, can you end the piece together, without talking about it?
