!Welcome to Mandela Gardens. 
[[Tap here to access a screen-reader version of this tutorial|manGard_ac]]

These gardens were dedicated to Nelson Mandela, in solidarity with his campaign against apartheid in South Africa. People came together here, to celebrate, when he became South Africa’s first Black president in 1994.

There are three pianos in the area. Are you here by yourself, or do you have company?

<<linkreplace "I came here by myself.">> If you came here by yourself, go to the piano on the plinth, which overlooks the other two.
<</linkreplace>>
<<linkreplace "Actually, I came here with a friend.">>If you’re here with a friend, get them to scan the QR code on their device, (or, just shout the instructions to them, across the square).

Then, set yourselves up on the pianos that are facing each other, and follow the instructions together.<</linkreplace>>

Before we do anything, however, we need to ensure the piano is working. Please play the following test keys, in any order, a few times over.

Jazz music has a rich and complex history, rooted in the people of African Diaspora communities, who were trafficked, and brought to the West, during the Transatlantic Slave Trade. Jazz fuses African musical traditions with Western musical traditions. 

One aspect that we’ll look at today, is the idea that Jazz, and music in general, can be like speaking, or having a conversation.
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>
 In the history of European music, musicians have always tended to write music down, and then have people perform it, exactly as it was recorded. 
 
 In many African countries, however, it's more common for music to spring from the relationship between musicians, their audience, and the context where music is being made. This approach to music, but using European instruments, is how Jazz arose in the West. 

So, how can we make pianos talk to each other?
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>
First of all, look back at the test keys. 

<img src="img/CEG_Highlighted.png" width="95%">

Play the three test keys at the same time. Whenever you play more than one note at the same time, it’s called playing a ‘chord’. Try that, and see how it sounds, in comparison to just playing a note by itself.

Once you’re happy with playing that chord, keep your left hand on it, and tap ‘Next Section’.

When we talk to another person, there can often be unspoken rules or conventions that indicate, for example, when one person is finished talking, and another person can begin. There’s no right or wrong way to converse. It will always vary according to culture, family, how much practice we’ve had, etc.
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>
Keep your left hand on the chord, the three notes.
Then, put your right hand on the notes highlighted below. Arrange your right hand so that every key highlighted in the picture has one finger on top of it. 
<<linkreplace "Optional: I need help with this.">>''Optional: I need help with this.''
Find two black keys on their own, and put your right-hand thumb on the white key just to the left of them. Then, put the rest of your fingers on the keys that follow it.<</linkreplace>>

<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>
Don’t worry, you won’t be asked to play both hands together. Get used to your hands being in this position. Try playing the keys a little to see how this position feels and sounds.

When you’re ready to move on, tap ‘Next Section’.

Think again about comparing music with a conversation. 

In some conversations, people will indicate to their partner that they’ve finished speaking. They might do this by lowering the pitch at the end of a sentence, or asking the other person a question. 

You can apply similar rules like this to music, and some Jazz musicians actually call this ‘conversation’.
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>
Look back at the piano. Make sure your hands are set up like this.

<img src="img/CEG2_and_CDEFG3.png" width="95%">

Try playing a few of the notes under your right fingers, just going up and down, and then use the three-note chord, in your left hand, to show when you’ve finished that section. Then, do it again.

Once you’re happy with this as a pattern, tap ‘Next’.

If you’ve been following these exercises with another person, you’ll probably have started to see how you can turn this shared set of rules into a duet, without having to read sheet music at all. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>
This style of playing has also been known as ‘cutting contests’ in the past. Cutting contests involve Jazz musicians testing each other's musical skills, and were common in the Harlem Jazz community in New York, between the 1940s and the 1970s. 

They were also a form of musical education. Competitors had to listen carefully, and respond to their opponent, and the audience reaction, in order to be the most entertaining performer. Musicians like James P. Johnson, Fats Waller, and Art Tatum, often battled it out at cutting contests. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>
In Black neighbourhoods, people often held 'Rent Parties', where the community came together, to enjoy music, dancing, and cutting contests. These parties were also a method for this marginalised community to provide mutual aid for those in need, as the entry fee went towards the rent, for the party hosts.

If you’re playing on your own, keep playing your conversation, but imagine you’re providing both parts, played by two characters. 
* Are they different ages?
* Are they arguing, or, are they confessing their love for each other?
* Does the conversation start suddenly, or, do they slowly notice each other from across a room?
If you’re with a friend, try to have a conversation, or a competition, through your pianos, using no words.

Once you’ve got the hang of that, tap ‘Next Section’

After a while, start to break the rules of conversation, and show that in your music. What does an interruption sound like? Or, can you mimic the other player, sarcastically? Can you patronise, or lie, using the piano? What other things are you not supposed to do in a conversation?

Find a way to use these techniques to bring the piece to a close. If you’re with a friend, can you end the piece together, without talking about it?
