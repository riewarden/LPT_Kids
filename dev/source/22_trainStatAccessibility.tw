!Welcome to Leeds Train Station. 
Before we make a start, please make sure that the piano is working. Please play any of the black keys in any order you like, preferably a few times over. 

All of the keyboard diagrams start with C. This is the flat, white key just before any two raised black keys. The white keys that follow C progress alphabetically until G, then start again from A. The white keys don't matter that much for this exercise. Just find the raised black keys, and play those.

Once you’ve tested the black keys, move to the next section.

!Percy Grainger and his trains
The next few exercises are inspired by the work of a composer called Percy Grainger, who absolutely loved trains, and actually wrote a lot of his music while riding on them, or while waiting for his friends at the station.

One of the pieces Percy Grainger created was called ‘Arrival Platform Humlet’. A ‘Humlet’ is described by Grainger as: 
>//‘The sort of thing one hums to oneself as an accompaniment to one’s tramping feet as one happily, excitedly, paces up and down the arrival platform.’//

!Imagine this...
A person is waiting for a train to arrive on the platform. 
You hear their footsteps walk a little way up the platform, 
then stop, turn, 
their footsteps walk back. 
Then, they turn again. 
And so on.

Now, look back at the black keys, and choose three that are next to each other.

Use those three keys to play music for a ‘Humlet’, to accompany your imaginary person walking up the platform. Try that for a bit, just imagining the footsteps walking up, and up, before moving on to the next section.

!Planning before playing
Now, just //before// the imaginary person turns, move your hand to another part of the keyboard with three black keys, it doesn't matter where. When you've chosen three new black keys, use them to play some music for the walk //down// the platform. 

Repeat this process, as many times as you need, to get used to the feeling of choosing three keys before you need them, then moving to them, and continuing to play.

When you’re happy with moving your hand to different groups of black keys, move to the next section.

!Bringing the other hand in
Try playing with groups of three black notes, exactly the same as you were before, but play one section with your left, and the next with your right, the one after with your left, and so on.

Get used to looking for a place to move your other hand to, //just before// you want to finish one section. 

!!You don't need to sprint up the platform
It’s up to you how long the sections last! If you can’t decide on the next set of notes to move to, just stall for time by playing more notes. No-one will notice!

!!Make it a marathon
See how long you can go for without stopping. Look ahead, and stall for time when you need it! 

Think about times when you’ve waited for a friend who is late, and the progression of emotions that arise from the waiting, and pacing. How can you describe that journey using the skills you’ve picked up in the last few minutes?

When you're ready, bring the piece to a close...
