A useful skill for music-making is being able to listen to the other sounds around you, to help you make a decision about what sounds you’d like to add to them.

Nearby, there is a sculpture, by Pianodrome, called Deep Listening, which has a cast-iron frame, that you can strike with a beater. Go over and play it, or wait for someone else to. Then, just listen to the sounds it can make. How are these sounds different to the sounds you just made with the piano?
<<linkreplace "Listen deeply.@@" t8n>>
When a sound starts to fade away, try to pinpoint the moment it turns from vibrations in the air, to stillness. How do these sounds blend with the other sounds, in and around the Rest Gardens?

How does the sound from the Deep Listening sculpture exist in the world, and how is it different to the piano? If you like, go back and forth between them, while you think about the next few questions.

<<linkreplace "How do we describe the sound?" t8n>><<linkreplace "Duration?" t8n>>''Duration:''
How long can the sound last? How short? How quickly can it make another sound? Does it need time to rest?<</linkreplace>>

<<linkreplace "Timbre?" t8n>>''Timbre:''
If this sound was a colour, or a shape, what would it look like? Does this sound have emotions? What makes this sound’s shape different to the piano’s shape?<</linkreplace>>

<<linkreplace "Pitch?" t8n>>''Pitch:''
Is this a high, or a low sound? If you hum the sound, is it easy for you to reach, or is it a strain?

When you’ve had enough listening for one day, click ‘Next’.

Now, go back to the piano. If you were playing the sculpture yourself, give the iron one last hit, and make a note that’s going to last a little while. If you were letting other people play, wait for someone to play another note.
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>> 
When you’re back at the piano, play any note, and let it go for a long time. Under your feet, you'll find some pedals. If you press down the right-hand one, this will make the note longer. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>> 
Now, play that note, and while it is playing, look for another note that sounds good with it. Maybe it sounds nice, maybe it just...sounds interesting. If you play some notes that don’t sound like what you wanted, that’s fine. Your journey to finding the note you want is now part of this composition that’s emerging.

When you're happy with those two notes, tap ‘Next’.

Now that you’ve found two notes that work together, look for more. Try playing some at the same time. Try playing them in sequences. If people come up to the sculpture to strike it, respond to the notes they create.

Find a time to come gently to a stop.
