A useful skill for music-making is being able to listen to the other sounds around you, to help you make a decision about what sounds you’d like to add to them.

Nearby, there is a sculpture, by Pianodrome, called Deep Listening, which has a cast-iron frame, that you can strike with a beater. Go over and play it, or wait for someone else to. Then, just listen to the sounds it can make. 
<<linkreplace "Listen deeply.@@" t8n>>
When a sound starts to fade away, try to pinpoint the moment it turns from vibrations in the air, to stillness. How do these sounds blend with the other sounds, in and around the Rest Gardens?

Go nice and slowly, and take at least three minutes to do this. When you’re ready to move on, click ‘Next’.

How does this sound exist in the world? Ask yourself questions, to create your understanding of the sound. There are no right answers. All you need to pursue is what feels right to you.

<<linkreplace "How do we describe the sound?" t8n>><<linkreplace "Duration" t8n>>''Duration:''
How long can the sound last? How short? How quickly can it make another sound? Does it need time to rest?<</linkreplace>>

<<linkreplace "Timbre" t8n>>''Timbre:''
If this sound was a colour, or a shape, what would it look like? Does this sound have emotions? What makes this sound’s shape different to the piano’s shape?<</linkreplace>>

<<linkreplace "Pitch@@" t8n>>''Pitch:''
Is this a high, or a low sound? If you hum the sound, is it easy for you to reach, or is it a strain?

<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>What other questions could you ask about the sound? Are there any questions you can’t find the answer to? Is it because no answer exists, or would you find it by asking someone else?

When you’ve had enough listening for one day, click ‘Next’.

@@.spButton;Now go back to the piano. If you were playing the sculpture yourself, give the iron one last hit, and make a note that’s going to last a little while. If you were letting other people play, wait for someone to play another note.
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>> 
When you’re back at the piano, listen to the iron note, and try and find a note on it that you think works well with the iron note. Search for the note very slowly. It could be the same note, it could be a contrasting note, or something else entirely. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>> 
If you play some notes that don’t sound like what you wanted, that’s great. The journey to finding the note you want is now going to be part of this composition that’s emerging, as you go along.

When you find a note you like, click ‘Next’.

Find a time to come gently to a stop.
