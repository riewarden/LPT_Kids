!Welcome to Leeds Playhouse! 
In the next couple of exercises, we’ll be looking at playing a simple piece which can grow for a long time, but which sprouts from just one note.

But, before we begin, please play the following test keys on the piano, to ensure that it is working. 

All of the keyboard diagrams start with C. This is the flat, white key just before any two raised black keys. The white keys that follow C progress alphabetically until G, then start again from A.

Once you’re certain the piano is working, move on to the next section.

!Introducing 'C Major'
Keep your hand resting comfortably on the test keys. The key which is furthest left, just before the two black keys, is called C, and it, along with all the rest of the white notes on the piano, are part of a group called ‘C Major’.

People who work with music will often group notes together, and give the groups names, to help them remember which groups of notes all tend to work well together. It also helps us talk about music, and have a way to make sure many people can know which notes we’re talking about at a given time. 

!!Why group notes like this? 
Grouping notes like this is not the only way to talk about music, but it’s quite common, kind of like how English and Chinese are very widespread, but they’re certainly not the only languages in the world. Hindustani music, for example, uses completely different ideas to understand and notate sound. However, this tutorial uses C Major.

!!The 'Root' note
So. Right now, we’re just looking at one group of notes, which is C Major, or, all the white keys. We also call it C Major, because C is the ‘root’ note of the group. Essentially, what this means is that if you play a few notes of C Major, and end on a C, it will sound ‘finished’. 

Have a go at doing that now. Here are the notes of C Major, with C highlighted for you. Just play three notes, and make the fourth note a C. ‘See’ what you think.

When you’re done experimenting, move on to the next section.

!Time to turn this root into a tree. 

All you need to do, as slowly as you like, is play sequences of notes that get longer and longer, but always return to C, the root. 

It doesn’t have to be the same pattern every time, you can just play any notes, while counting up to the number you need, then play C again.
Try beginning like this... Start by playing one note, then C.
* Then, two notes, then C.
* Then three notes, then C.
* And so on.

Play all the white keys on the keyboard! What happens when you throw in a black note or two? (Those are the raised keys). If it sounds a bit ‘wrong’ or ‘strange’, try playing it again, and again. 

Find a way to weave it into the piece, like an unexpected wildflower. Don’t worry about losing count. It won’t really matter after a while.

!!When you feel yourself getting tired...
Choose a low number like 5, and play decreasing numbers of notes, always ending on C, until you find an ending.
