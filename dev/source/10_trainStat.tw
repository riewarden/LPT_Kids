Before we make a start, please make sure that the piano is working. Please play any of the black keys in any order you like, preferably a few times over.

(They're orange in the picture, and black in real life!)

Once you’ve tested the keys, tap ‘Next’.

The next few exercises are inspired by the work of a composer called Percy Grainger, who absolutely loved trains, and actually wrote a lot of his music while riding on them, or while waiting for his friends at the station.
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>
One of the pieces Percy Grainger created was called ‘Arrival Platform Humlet’. A ‘Humlet’ is described by Grainger as: 
>//‘The sort of thing one hums to oneself as an accompaniment to one’s tramping feet as one happily, excitedly, paces up and down the arrival platform.’//

Picture this: 

A person is waiting for a train to arrive on the platform. 
They walk a little way up the platform, 
then stop, turn, 
and walk back. 
Then, they turn again. 
And so on.

<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>Now, look back at the black keys, and choose three that are next to each other. 

<img src="img/All_Black_Keys.png" width="90%">

<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>Use those three keys to play music for a ‘Humlet’, to accompany your imaginary person walking up the platform. Try that for a bit. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>
Now, just //before// the imaginary person turns, look at the keyboard, and choose three different keys, it doesn’t matter which ones, and move your hand to them. Then, play some music for the walk //down// the platform. 

Repeat this process, as many times as you need, to get used to the feeling of choosing keys, then moving to them.

When you’re happy with moving your hand to different groups of black keys, tap ‘Next’.

Now, it’s time to bring the other hand in. Try playing groups of three black notes, the Humlets, exactly the same as you were before, but play one Humlet with your left, and the next with your right, and so on.

Get used to looking for a place to move your other hand to, //just before// you want to finish one Humlet. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>
You don’t need to do this quickly. It’s up to you how long the Humlets last! If you can’t decide on the next set of notes to move to, just stall for time by playing more notes. No-one will notice!

When you’re happy with playing the black keys, and moving your hand to new places, tap ‘Next’.

Now, see how long you can go for without stopping, looking ahead and stalling for time when you need it! 

Think about times when you’ve waited for a friend who is late, and the progression of emotions that arise from the waiting, and pacing. How can you describe that journey using the skills you’ve picked up in the last few minutes?

When you're ready...
