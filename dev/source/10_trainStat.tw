Before we make a start, please make sure that the piano is working. Please play any of the black keys in any order you like, preferably a few times over.

Once you’ve tested the keys, tap ‘Next Section’.

:: Train2
The next few exercises are inspired by the work of a composer called Percy Grainger, who absolutely loved trains, and actually wrote a lot of his music while riding on them, or while waiting for his friends at the station.

One of the pieces Percy Grainger created was called ‘Arrival Platform Humlet’. A ‘Humlet’ is described by Grainger as: 
>//‘The sort of thing one hums to oneself as an accompaniment to one’s tramping feet as one happily, excitedly, paces up and down the arrival platform.’//

:: Train2-1

Picture this: 

A person is waiting for a train to arrive on the platform. 
They walk a little way up the platform, 
then stop, turn, 
and walk back. 
Then, they turn again. 
And so on.

<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>>Now, look back at the black keys, and choose three that are next to each other. 

<img src="img/All_Black_Keys.png" width="90%">

<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>>Play those three keys in any order, to accompany your imaginary person walking up the platform. Try that for a bit. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>>
Now, just //before// the imaginary person turns, look at the keyboard, and choose three different keys, it doesn’t matter which ones, and move your hand to them. Then, play some music for the walk //down// the platform. 

Repeat this process, as many times as you need, to get used to the feeling of choosing keys, then moving to them.

When you’re happy with moving your hand to different groups of black keys, tap ‘Next Section’.

Now, it’s time to bring the other hand in. Try playing with groups of three black notes, exactly the same as you were before, but play one section with your left, and the next one with your right, then the next with your left, and so on.

Get used to looking for a place to move your other hand to, //just before// you want to finish one section. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>>
You don’t need to do this quickly. It’s up to you how long the sections last! If you can’t decide on the next set of notes to move to, just stall for time by playing more notes. No-one will notice!

When you’re happy with playing the black keys, and moving both of your hands around, tap ‘Next Section’.
[[Next Section|Train4]]

:: Train4
Now, see how long you can go for without stopping, looking ahead and stalling for time when you need it! 

Think about times when you’ve waited for a friend who is late, and the progression of emotions that arise from the waiting, and pacing. How can you describe that journey using the skills you’ve picked up in the last few minutes?

When you're ready...bring the piece to a close.
