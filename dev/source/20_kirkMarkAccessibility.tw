!Welcome to Kirkgate Market! 
This place has seen its fair share of destruction, but always seems to rise from the ashes. In World War Two, even though it was frequently hit by bombs, it never closed for more than a few days. In 1975, a fire destroyed two thirds of the market (luckily, it didn’t kill anyone), and it still opened three days later! The spirit of the market has blazed brighter than its adversities for 120 years. 

We’ll be taking //fire// as an inspiration for the next few exercises. This place can handle it. 

!!Testing the piano
Before we begin, however, we need to make sure the piano is working. Please play the following test keys a few times over. You can use two fingers on one hand, or use both hands. All of the keyboard diagrams start with C. This is the flat, white key just before any two raised black keys. The white keys that follow C progress alphabetically until G, then start again from A.

Once you’re sure that the piano is working, move to the next section.

!Imagine a //spark//. A bright point of light, which quickly dies.
<img src="img/spark.png" width="90%" alt="A hand using a lighter to create a spark of light, in a dark environment.">

 Starting with the test keys, play a single note, which you think sounds like a //spark//. 

<img src="img/FG_keys.png" width="90%" alt="The keys ‘F' and 'G’ are highlighted.">

Then, play a few of those. Sometimes, a //spark// ignites another //spark//. What does that sound like?

!From sparks, //flames// can grow. 
<img src="img/fire.png" width="90%" alt="A small bonfire on a hill, with a cloudy sky.">

Now, find any two white keys that have one white note between them. Play them back and forth, over and over, like a flickering //flame//. 

(Musicians often call this kind of playing a ‘trill’.)

How does that sound different from the //sparks//? What does it sound like when a spark becomes a //flame//?

When you’re happy with how your //sparks// and //flames// sound, move to the next section.

!Finally, //flames// can become a //blaze//. 
<img src="img/blaze.png" width="90%" alt="A tall fire, burning brightly, engulfing an indistinct object, in a dark environment."> 

Starting from the middle of the keyboard, find two keys that have one key between them, like a flame. Put one finger from your left hand on the left key, and one finger from your right hand, on the right key. 

Play the two keys like a flame, then, move both of your hands one key outwards, so there’s now a gap of three notes in between. Play them back and forth, as a trill. Then, move outwards again. How big can you make the //blaze//?

Play with the //sparks//, //flames//, and the //blaze//. When you feel you can make all three sound different from each other, Move to the next section.

!Finally, imagine that you’re making a film about a fire.
Starting from the first //spark//, to the //ashes// it leaves behind. 

The things you're pointing the imaginary camera at becomes the music that your audience hears. The //sparks//, the //flames//, and the //blaze//.
* What do you film first? 
* How do you show the movement of the fire? 
* Does anyone try and stop it? How does that change your playing?
Bring the piece to a close, by finding a way to show the heat and light fading. What do ashes sound like?
