!Welcome to the Victoria Quarter. 
Did you know that there used to be a music hall here, where Harvey Nichols now stands? 

It’s funny to think that what is now a luxury department store, used to be a place where you could go to watch stand-up comedy, magic, juggling, and listen to people singing naughty songs in front of a piano…No such luck these days!

Before we start with the exercises, please make sure the piano is working. To test the piano, please play the three test keys shown, in any order:

Once you’re sure the piano is working, tap ‘Next’.

How can we sit at the piano, and make something sound like a tune? 

Well, one of the secrets is to just //repeat things!// 

Humans love looking for patterns, so much so, that we often think we see links or causes between events, when there is no evidence for it. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>
Think about fake news, conspiracy theorists, and how politicians assign blame to whatever groups their voters seem most likely to turn against…

So, while our love of patterns can be very unhelpful at times, it is a big part of how we make sense of music, and many other forms of art.

 You may have no plan for what kind of art you’re going to make. But, if you decide on something you’re going to repeat, or keep coming back to, people will be able to find patterns fairly easily. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>
The way the audience responds to your patterns, and the way you respond to their responses, and so on… That is one of the joys of improvised music.

Great. Let’s put that into practice, shall we?

Go back to the test keys, from earlier.

<img src="img/CEG_Highlighted.png" width="400vw">

Play the three keys from left to right. Notice that they’re all white keys, and they all have a gap of one white key between them, (for this set of exercises, ignore the black keys.)

When you’re happy with playing these keys, go back to the middle. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>
Now, shift your hand one key to the right, so that the starting note of the pattern is now one note higher. Then, play the same pattern as before. Then, move up one more key, and do it again. 

Keep playing the pattern, and moving up, until you reach the end of the keyboard. This doesn’t have to be fast. Just listen to how the pattern of three notes changes, depending on where you are on the keyboard. 

When you’re finished with this, tap ‘Next’.

Try and push this simple pattern to its limits.

* Can you make it sound happy? 
* How does speed affect the way it sounds? 
* Are there any emotions, or ideas that this pattern is particularly good at? 
* What is it not so good at? 

There are no right answers. 

Try to explain to yourself why you feel the way you do about certain combinations of notes.
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>
Try and find ways to use this pattern in a surprising way. If you play the same pattern over and over, and then suddenly do something different, that can be exciting to listen to.

When you’ve finished exploring the patterns, and breaking them apart, bring the piece to a close.
