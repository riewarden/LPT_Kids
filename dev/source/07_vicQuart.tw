Hello. Welcome to the Victoria Quarter. Did you know that there used to be a music hall here, where Harvey Nichols is? It’s funny to think that what is now a luxury department store, used to be a place where you could go to watch stand-up comedy, magic, juggling, and listen to people singing naughty songs in front of a piano…No such luck these days!

Before we start with the exercises, please make sure the piano is working. If it isn’t working, please [[tap here to contact a member of staff|dave.cartwright@leedspiano.com]]. To test the piano, please play the three test keys shown, in any order:

A big secret about making something sound like a tune is: just repeat things! 
Humans love looking for patterns, so much so, that we often think we see links or causes between events, when there is no evidence for it. Think about fake news, conspiracy theorists, and how politicians assign blame to whatever groups their voters seem most likely to turn on…

So, while our love of patterns can be very unhelpful at times, it is a big part of how we make sense of music, and many other forms of art. You may have no plan for what kind of art you’re going to make. But, if you decide on something you’re going to repeat, or keep coming back to, people will be able to find patterns fairly easily. 
The way the audience creates their own patterns, from your music, and how you respond to them doing this… That is one of the joys of improvised music.
Great. Let’s put that into practice, shall we?

Go back to the test keys, from earlier.

=Image: Piano keys, with CEG labelled.=

Play the three keys from left to right. Notice that they’re all white keys, and they all have a gap of one white key between them, (for this set of exercises, ignore the black keys.)

When you’re happy with playing these keys, go back to the middle. Now, shift your hand one key to the right, so that the starting note of the pattern is now one note higher. Then, play the same pattern as before. Then, move up one more key, and do it again. 
Keep going until you reach the end of the keyboard. This doesn’t have to be fast. Just listen to how the pattern of three notes changes, depending on where you are on the keyboard. 

When you’re finished with this, tap ‘Next’.

Sticking with the same pattern, go down to the lowest notes, and see how it sounds there. Or, play it backwards.

Can you make it sound happy? Can you make it sad? Or angry? Maybe you need to try a different speed for that. Are there any emotions, or ideas that this pattern is particularly good at? What is it not so good at? There are no right answers. Just try to explain to yourself why you feel the way you do about certain combinations of notes.

Using this pattern of three notes, find ways to create other patterns. Why not try patterns of speed, or loudness, or pitch? Perhaps every third time you play the three notes, it’s always the highest possible pitch? Then, try and find ways to subvert those patterns, to surprise your audience. If you play the same pattern over and over, and then suddenly do something different, that can be exciting to listen to.

When you’ve finished exploring the patterns, and breaking them apart, bring the piece to a close.
