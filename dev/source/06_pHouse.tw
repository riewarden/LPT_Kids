In the next couple of exercises, we’ll be looking at playing a simple piece which can grow for a long time, but which sprouts from just one note.

But, before we begin, please play the following test keys on the piano, to ensure that it is working.

Once you’re certain it’s working, tap ‘Next Section’.

Keep your hand resting comfortably on some of the test keys. The key which is furthest left, just before the two black keys, is called C, and it, along with all the rest of the white notes on the piano, are part of a group called ‘C Major’.

<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>>People who work with music will often group notes together, and give the groups names, to help them remember which groups of notes all tend to work well together. 

It also helps us talk about music, and have a way to make sure many people can know which notes we’re talking about at a given time. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>>
Grouping notes like this is not the only way to talk about music, but it’s quite common, kind of like how English and Chinese are very widespread, but they’re certainly not the only languages in the world. 

Hindustani music, for example, uses completely different ideas to understand and notate sound. However, this tutorial uses C Major.

So. Right now, we’re just looking at one group of notes, which is C Major, or, all the white keys. We also call it C Major, because C is the ‘root’ note of the group. 

Essentially, what this means is that if you play a few notes of C Major, and end on a C, it will sound ‘finished’. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>>
Have a go at doing that now. Here are the notes of C Major, with C highlighted for you. Just play three notes, and make the fourth note a C. ‘See’ what you think. Try it a few times.

When you’re done experimenting, tap ‘Next Section’.

Now, it’s time to turn this root into a tree. 

<img src="img/C_Major_with_obvious_C.png" width="95%">

All you need to do, as slowly as you like, is play sequences of notes that get longer and longer, but always return to C, the root. 

It doesn’t have to be the same pattern every time, you can just play any notes, while counting up to the number you need, then play C again.
<<linkreplace "Try beginning like this..." t8n>>* Start by playing one note, then C.
* Then, two notes, then C.
* Then three notes, then C.
* And so on.

Play all the white keys on the keyboard! What happens when you throw in a black note or two? If it sounds a bit ‘wrong’ or ‘strange’, try playing it again, and again, until it becomes a pattern. 

And don’t worry about losing count of the number of notes that you're supposed to be up to. It won’t really matter after a while. Start from one, and see where it goes.
<<linkreplace "When you feel yourself getting tired..." t8n>>
Choose a low number like 5, and play decreasing numbers of notes, always ending on C, until you find an ending.
<<linkreplace "Tap to finish." t8n>>
