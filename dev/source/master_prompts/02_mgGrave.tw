Before we begin, please play any of the following test keys, in any order, to ensure the piano is working.

If all is well, tap the 'Next Section' button below.

When listening to music, we often pay a lot of attention to the notes...but not the spaces in-between the notes. The silences between notes are often called 'rests', in music. 

Pretty apt that we’re in the ‘Rest Gardens’ to think about ‘rests’!

The parts of an artwork where there is no ink, or sculpture, or paint, is sometimes called ‘negative space’. 

In Japanese art, this is called ‘ma’, and it is just as important, if not more important, as the rest of an artwork.

Think about a song you know. It can be anything, and it doesn’t have to be a piano song. 

Imagine that you broke this song into pieces, and then changed how the silences, or pauses, appeared in it. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>> 
How would it change with no silences at all? Or, if there was more silence than notes? How about a patchwork of both of those? 

How much can you mess with the gaps between notes, while still being able to recognise the song?

When you’ve had enough of that, tap 'Next Section'.

Go back to these keys that you used to test the piano, pictured below. 

Arrange your hands so that every key highlighted in the picture has one finger on top of it. Your left hand should go over the keys on the left, and your right hand, over the keys on the right.

Got it? Tap ‘Next Section’.

Using the keys under your fingers, find a pattern of three notes that you like. If you take a while to find one, don’t worry. That journey is a part of the process of improvising. No-one’s going to know that it’s just you figuring things out. 

Play the pattern of three a few times, until it’s familiar. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>> 
Now, play the pattern three times, but on the third time, don’t play the final note. Let the absence of the note be an intentional part of the piece, and not a mistake. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>>
<img src="img/missing.png" width="95%">

Think about the missing note.
* What do you feel ‘should be there’? 
* Why does it matter, when it isn’t there?
* If you feel like this is just ‘bad music’, what exactly about it is ‘bad’? 
There’s no right answer, just try to explain to yourself why it is that you feel the way you do about the missing note.
<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>> 
If you’re not sure, perhaps try a longer sequence, which has more of a build-up, before the missing note. 

When you’ve had enough. Tap ‘Next Section’.

Last part. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>> 
Take a moment to listen to the silence around you. 
* Is it really silence? 
* What noises are in the distance? 
* Are there sounds which don’t //sound// like sounds because they’re constant?
<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>> Now, using the same keys, and some of the techniques from the previous exercise, experiment with playing notes, and creating sequences, while focusing almost completely on the space created //between// the notes.
<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>> 
Go nice and slowly. Try and imagine the silences existing as a physical force, like a ripple of water, as it expands outwards. How can you fit the notes around noises that are already here? 

Take as long as you need with this.
<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>>
When you feel satisfied, bring the piece to a close, listening for the moment the last note stops being vibrations in the air, and silence returns.
