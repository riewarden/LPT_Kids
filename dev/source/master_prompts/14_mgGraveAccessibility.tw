!Welcome to the Merrion Centre Rest Gardens.
Before we begin, please play any of the following test keys, in any order, to ensure the piano is working. 

All of the keyboard diagrams start with C. This is the flat, white key just before any two raised black keys. The white keys that follow C progress alphabetically until G, then start again from A.

!In music, we can choose to pay a lot of attention to the notes, but not the space in between the notes. 
The silences between notes are often called 'rests', in music. Pretty apt that we’re in the ‘Rest Gardens’ to think about ‘rests’!

The parts of an artwork where there is no ink, or sculpture, or paint, is sometimes called ‘negative space’ in English. In Japanese art, it’s known as ‘ma’, and tends to be seen as just as important, if not more important, as the rest of an artwork.

!Think about a song you know. 
It can be anything, doesn’t have to be piano. Imagine that you broke it into pieces, and then changed how the silence, or pauses, appeared in it. 

How would it change with no silences at all? Or, if there was more silence than notes? How about a patchwork of both of those? How much can you mess with the gaps between notes, and still be able to recognise the song?

!Go back to these keys that you used to test the piano, pictured below. 
Arrange your hands so that every key highlighted in the diagram has one finger on top of it.

!Optional: I need help with this
Find two black keys on their own, and put your left-hand little finger on the white key just to the left of them. Then, put the rest of your fingers on the following keys.

Then, find another key like this, to the left of two black keys, put your right-hand thumb on it, and put the rest of your fingers on the following keys.

Using the keys under your fingers, find a pattern of three notes that you like. 

If you take a while to find one, don’t worry. That journey is a part of the process of improvising. No-one’s going to know that it’s just you figuring things out.

!Play the pattern of three a few times, until it’s familiar. 
Now, play it three times, but on the third time, don’t play the final note. Let the absence of the note be an intentional part of the piece, and not a mistake. 

* What do you feel ‘should be there’? 
* Why does it matter, when it isn’t there?
* If you feel like this is just ‘bad music’, what exactly about it is ‘bad’? 
There’s no right answer, just try to explain to yourself why it is that you feel the way you do about the missing note.

If you’re not sure, repeat the exercise, or perhaps try different sequences. 

!Last part. 
Take a moment to listen to the silence around you. 
* Is it really silence? 
* What noises are in the distance? 
* Are there sounds which don’t sound like sounds because they’re constant?
Now, using the same keys, and some of the techniques from the previous exercise, experiment with playing notes, and creating sequences, while focusing almost completely on the space created between the notes.

!Go nice and slowly. 
Try and imagine the silences existing as a physical force, like a light that comes on, or a drop of water falling into a pond. How can you fit the notes around the noise that already exists here? 

Take as long as you need with this.

When you feel satisfied, bring the piece to a close, listening for the moment the last note stops being vibrations in the air, and silence returns.
