!Welcome to the Merrion Street Rest Gardens.
Before we begin, please play any of the highlighted test keys, in any order, to ensure the piano is working. 

All of the keyboard images start with C. This is the flat, white key just before any two raised black keys. The white keys that follow C progress alphabetically until G, then start again from A.

!A useful skill for music-making is being able to listen to the other sounds around you
This helps you make a decision about what sounds you’d like to add to them.

Nearby, there is a sculpture, by Pianodrome, called Deep Listening, which has a cast-iron frame, that you can strike with a beater. Go over and play it, or wait for someone else to. Then, just listen to the sounds it can make. 

When a sound starts to fade away, try to pinpoint the moment it turns from vibrations in the air, to stillness. How do these sounds blend with the other sounds, in and around the Rest Gardens? 

Imagine the sound as ripples of water, moving outwards, and colliding with whatever they hit.

How does the sound from the Deep Listening sculpture exist in the world, and how is it different to the piano? If you like, go back and forth between them, and compare their sounds, while you think about the next few questions.

!How do we describe the sound?
!!Duration
How long can the sound last? How short? How quickly can it make another sound? Does it need time to rest?
!!Timbre
If this sound was a colour, or a shape, what would it look like? Does this sound have emotions? What makes this sound’s shape different to the piano’s shape?
!!Pitch
Is this a high, or a low sound? If you hum the sound, is it easy for you to reach, or is it a strain?

What other questions could you ask about the sound?

!Now, go back to the piano. 
When you’re back at the piano, play any note, and let it go for a long time. Under your feet, you'll find some pedals. If you press down the one on the right, this will make the note last longer. 

Now, play that note, and while it is playing, look for another note that sounds good with it. Maybe it sounds pretty, maybe it sounds strange, or spooky. It's up to you.

If you play some notes that don’t sound like what you wanted, that’s fine. Your journey to finding the note you want is now part of this composition that’s emerging.

Look for more and more notes that you like the sound of. Try playing some at the same time. Try playing them in sequences. 

Find a time to come gently to a stop.
