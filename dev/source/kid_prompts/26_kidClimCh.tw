Welcome to the piano. Today, we’ll take a look at how music can help us connect with one of the greatest threats to human life in living memory. Climate Change. Before we get into that, it’s important to make sure the pianos is working. Please play the following test keys in any order.

= Test keys: C Eb F =

If the piano is not working, please contact a member of staff.
When you’ve done that, you have two options before you move on. You can learn a little bit about what ‘Climate Change’ is, or if you already know all that, you can skip to the next bit.
-	Tell me about Climate Change?
-	Skip the stuff about Climate Change. -> What does this have to do with music?

> Tell me about Climate Change?
A ‘climate’ is the name for what the weather looks like, in a particular place, over a really long time. If you kept a diary of the weather for the UK over 100 years, and compared it to a diary of the weather in the Sahara Desert, over 100 years, they would be two very different stories. That means that the UK and the Sahara desert have two different ‘climates’. We can also think of the Earth as having one big climate, made of all the little ones.

‘Climate Change’ has been a big topic in the news, because for a long time now, humans, particularly the humans who run big companies and like to make lots of money, have caused the Earth’s climate to change for the worse. Pollution from cars, factories, rubbish tips, and more, create hot gases (also called ‘greenhouse gases’). Greenhouse gases heat up the Earth, and one of the things this does is melt the Polar Ice Caps. These are huge masses of ice on both sides of the world, so when they melt, seas all over the Earth rise. This destroys the homes of people, and animals. That’s only one effect of climate change.

You can read more about Climate Change on NASA’s website. Always be careful about who you get your information from about Climate Change. Big companies love to pretend that Climate Change isn’t real, to try and make everyone stop being cross with them, for making it so bad. NASA is a good source of information about Climate Change because they are an organisation of scientists, not business owners.

> What does this have to do with music?
Take a look at all these charts. Go on. Look at all these charts, and just…understand them.

= Ridiculous number of charts from various climate orgs =

Did you understand all the charts? Do you now feel completely equipped to tackle Climate Change? No?
That’s ok. In fact, that’s completely normal. Charts, and facts, and figures are often the way we see Climate Change represented. But humans are not computers. We can’t just eat numbers, and then do what the numbers say we should do. 
Humans do things because we are driven by emotions. When we are given lots of information that tells us a lot of stressful and horrible things, we tend to shut it out. Otherwise, we’d probably be crying, every second of every day.
This is where art, and in our case, music, can help us.
-	How do you expect me to change the world with a piano?

Let’s start with something small. Take a look at this chart.
 
For reference, just one million square kilometers is the size of four United Kingdoms! Take a second to think about how much ice would be in 7 million square kilometers.

This chart shows the amount of Arctic Sea Ice over time. In the Arctic, the sea water freezes and thaws naturally, over the course of a single year. Because of Climate Change, the total amount of ice is melting more and more, as the years go by. You can see the years going by at the bottom of the chart. They go up in 8’s. How can we show years, using music?

Find this set of keys on the piano. They’re the same ones from earlier.

= Test keys: C Eb F =

Play all the keys at the same time, with your left hand. This is called a ‘chord’.
The first year on the chart is 1976. Play the chord to represent the start of that year. Then, again for 1984. Then, again, for the rest of the years. 
Practice reading the chart from left to right, and playing your chord, every time you reach a year marker, on the grid. Notice where the line spikes, and flattens. As you’re playing the years, in the back of your mind, think about how this line might fit alongside the years.
-	I’m happy playing this chord, and I’m ready to move on.

> I’m happy playing this chord, and I’m ready to move on.
Give the chord a rest, and look at all the white keys on the keyboard.
Look at the chart again, specifically at the line which shows the total amount of ice, over time. We are going to play higher notes when the line is higher, and lower notes when the line is lower. Don’t play the whole chart just yet, we’ll do that soon. For the moment, think about this:
1.	Where should the first note of the song be?
2.	Where should the last note be?
3.	Where should the middle note be, just after the year ‘2000’?
If you decide this before starting, you won’t run out of keyboard when you play the whole thing. You don’t need to remember these notes exactly, but having a rough idea is useful.

-	I’m ready to move on.


> I’m ready to move on.
Here’s the chart:
= Chart =
Time to make music from data. Notice the places on the line where it changes direction, and makes points, and dips, to show the amount of ice over time. When the line goes up, you’ll play a higher note, when it points down, play a lower note.
Start by using your left hand to play the chord for 1976, then your right hand to play the notes for the ice level over that period. Then, when you reach 1984, play the chord in your left hand again, and play the notes for the next 8 years. Keep going, until you reach the end of the chart.
Tap the button below to play some atmospheric noise, to accompany the piece:
-	Button (Which plays the noise of the sea, arctic birds, the wind)

While you play, think about the following things:
1.	What do you imagine the ice doing, as you play?
2.	When is the piece easiest to play?
3.	Apart from the pitch of the notes, is there anything about the sound of the piece that changes as time goes on?

Bring the piece to a close, and take a moment to think about how the music connected with the data, and what emotions may have arisen. If you didn’t feel anything, that’s alright too.

This tutorial was inspired by the work of Judy Twedt. She is a climate scientist whose whole job is to turn climate data into music, to make it easier for people to empathise with the scale of the climate crisis.
