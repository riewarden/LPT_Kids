!Welcome to Impromptunes: The Sound of Climate Change
Note: This tutorial is immensely inspired by the work of climate scientist and data sonifier, Judy Twedt. Links to her work are provided at the end.

Welcome to the piano. Today, we’ll take a look at how music can help us connect with one of the greatest threats to human life in living memory. Climate Change. Before we get into that, it’s important to make sure the pianos is working. Please play the following test keys in any order.

If the piano is not working, please contact a member of staff.

When you are sure the piano is working, you have two options before you move on. You can learn a little bit about what ‘Climate Change’ is, or if you already know all that, you can skip to the next bit.

A ‘climate’ is the name for what the weather looks like, in a particular place, over a really long time. If you kept a diary of the weather for the UK over 100 years, and compared it to a diary of the weather in the Sahara Desert, over 100 years, they would be two very different stories. That means that the UK and the Sahara desert have two different ‘climates’. We can also think of the Earth as having one big climate, made of all the little ones.

‘Climate Change’ has been a big topic in the news, because for a long time now, humans, particularly the humans who run big companies and like to make lots of money, have caused the Earth’s climate to change for the worse.

Pollution from cars, factories, rubbish tips, and more, create hot gases (also called ‘greenhouse gases’). Greenhouse gases heat up the Earth, and one of the things this does is melt the Polar Ice Caps. These are huge masses of ice on both sides of the world. When they melt, the water rises in seas, all over the Earth.

These are people from the islands of Kutubdia, in Bangladesh. Climate Change has caused the islands to become flooded with seawater, destroying homes and crops. This is just one of the many effects of Climate Change.

Always be careful about where you get your information about Climate Change from. Big companies love to pretend that Climate Change isn’t real, to try and make everyone stop being cross with them, for making it so bad. The information in this tutorial is primarily from NASA. NASA is a good source of information about Climate Change because they are an organisation of scientists, not business owners. They have decades of research which concludes that Climate Change is real.

Take a look at all these charts. Go on. Look at all these charts, and just…understand them. If you're having trouble reading them, turn your device landscape, and zoom in.

Did you understand all the charts? 
Do you now feel completely equipped to tackle Climate Change? 
No?
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>
That’s ok. In fact, that’s completely normal. Charts, and facts, and figures are often the way we see Climate Change represented. But humans are not computers. We can’t just eat numbers, and then do what the numbers say we should do. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>
Humans do things because we are driven by emotions. When we are given lots of information that tells us a lot of stressful and horrible things, we tend to shut it out. Otherwise, we’d probably all be crying, every second of every day.

This is where art, and in our case, music, can help us.

Fair enough. Let’s start with something small. Take a look at this chart.

 <img src="img/edited_SeaIce.png" width="90%">
This chart shows the amount of Arctic Sea Ice that exists, over time, in 'millions of square kilometers'. In the Arctic, the sea water freezes and thaws naturally, over the course of a single year. 

Because of Climate Change, however, the total amount of ice is melting more and more, as the years go by. You can see the years going by at the bottom of the chart. They go up in 8’s. 

For reference, just one million square kilometers is the size of four United Kingdoms! The Arctic Sea Ice started at //seven// million square kilometers. Take a second to think about how much ice that could be, and what it would look like. 

It is certainly a lot of ice.

Find this set of keys on the piano. They’re the same ones from earlier.

<img src="img/C4_Eb4_F4.png" width="90%">

Play all the keys at the same time, with your left hand. This is called a ‘chord’.
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>
The first year on the chart is 1976. 

 <img src="img/edited_SeaIce.png" width="90%">

Practice reading the chart from left to right, and playing your chord, every time you reach a year marker, on the grid. First, play the chord to represent 1976. Then, again for 1984. Then, again, for the rest of the years. 

 As you’re playing the years, in the back of your mind, motice where the line on the graph spikes, and flattens. Think about how this line might fit alongside the years.

[[I’m happy playing this chord, and I’m ready to move on.|playchord]]

:: playchord
Give the chord a rest, and look at all the white keys on the keyboard. Have a play of some of them. We will use them in just a second.

<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>
Look at the chart again, specifically at the jagged line, which shows the total amount of ice, over time. 

 <img src="img/edited_SeaIce.png" width="90%">

We are going to play higher notes when the line is higher, and lower notes when the line is lower. Don’t play the whole chart just yet, we’ll do that soon. For the moment, think about this:

# Which key, on the keyboard, should you use for the first note?
# Which key should you use for the last note?
# What area of the keyboard should you be on, just after the year ‘2000’?

If you decide these things before starting, you won't accidentally start too high, or too low, and you won’t run out of keyboard at the end. You don’t need to remember these keys exactly, but having a rough idea is useful.

<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>
 <img src="img/edited_SeaIce.png" width="90%">

Start by using your left hand to play the chord for 1976, then your right hand to play the notes for the ice level over that period. 

When the line goes up, play a higher note. 
When it points down, play a lower note.
Then, when you reach 1984, play the chord in your left hand again, and play the notes for the next 8 years. 

Keep going, until you reach the end of the chart.
<<linkreplace "I've finished." t8n>>
Take a moment to think about how you felt before you started playing, and how you feel, now that you've finished. Also, think about the following questions:

# When was the piece easiest to play?
# Apart from the pitch of the notes, what else changes about the music, as time goes on?
# If you didn't know this music was inspired by a chart on Climate Change, what might you think it was about, instead?
