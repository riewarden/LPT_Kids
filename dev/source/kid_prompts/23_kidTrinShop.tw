!Welcome to Trinity Shopping Centre! 
This activity is for a child, and their adult. The next couple of exercises will get you playing the piano for the first time. Before we begin, we need to check to make sure the piano is working. If it isn’t:

Please play the following five test keys in any order, preferably several times over:

Once you’re satisfied all the keys are working, tap ‘Next’.

Rhythm is often understood as a regular, repeated pattern of sound. But, doesn’t have to sound the same, over and over. Make it up as you go! Put your fingers on these two keys, and have your adult find the same keys, somewhere else on the keyboard. Play the notes one by one, then, play them all at the same time.

Now, find lots of different rhythms and beats, just using these four keys. Try not to keep it the same for too long. Imagine you have to do a whole song, with just these four keys, over and over. How are you going to stop yourself falling asleep? How can you surprise yourself?

Once you’ve had enough of that, tap ‘Next’ to add some more notes! Don’t worry, neither of you have to play anything with both hands at the same time (unless you want to.)

Great. Now it’s time to spice things up. Now, find these keys on the keyboard, and have your adult find them somewhere else.

Try playing them, and see how they sound. Start by playing them in order, from left to right, together. Then, play them again, but play each note twice before moving on. Once you’re both happy doing that, the two of you should try playing the keys in any order you like.

Your adult might be worried about making it sound ‘nice’, and may be tempted to tell you how they think you should play. It is not their place to do this. If they try to tell you how to play, //point at this paragraph!//

When you’re happy with how the notes work together, you can probably guess what’s next.

A bit of reading, but, I promise that it’s interesting: 
These notes come from something called 'Blues music'. Blues music comes all the way from ancient African musical traditions. Blues were often sung by enslaved African people, to rebel against their white captors, during the Slave Trade. You can still find bits of Blues music in almost every modern song.

 Understanding where music comes from allows us to admire and value the communities who were put through unnecessary harm, like the Africans who were kidnapped and sold, but still made incredible art, that we can still hear today.

Reading is over. Time for playing! Have your adult find these this set of keys in two places on the keyboard.

And, then, go back to these keys (or, find two sets of these keys on the keyboard.)

Use everything we’ve done so far to make your own music. 
Remember, there’s no need to try and play with both hands at the same time. Play in the way that is easiest, and most fun, for you.

Your adult should make some rhythms with their keys, while you make tunes with your keys.
<<linkreplace "Tap to read more." t8n>> 
To play something like the Blues, play a tune together. Then, repeat what you just did. Then, the third time, play most of it again, but make the ending a bit different.

Find a way to end your piece.
