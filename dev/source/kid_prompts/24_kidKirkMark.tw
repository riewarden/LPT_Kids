Hello, and welcome to Kirkgate Market! This place has seen its fair share of destruction, but always seems to rise from the ashes. In World War Two, even though it was frequently hit by bombs, it hardly closed. In 1975, a fire destroyed two thirds of the market (luckily, it didn’t kill anyone), and it still opened three days later! The spirit of the market has blazed brighter than its adversities for 120 years.

We’ll be taking fire as an inspiration for the next few exercises. This place can handle it. Before we begin, however, we need to make sure the piano is working. If it isn’t working, [please tap here to contact a member of staff.| info@leedspiano.com]

Please play the following test keys a few times over. You can use two fingers on one hand, or use both hands.

Once you’re sure that the piano is working, tap ‘Next’.

Both of you are going to create sparks. To play a spark, imagine a bright light that quickly disappears, and play a quick note on the piano. Make sure to share the piano! Perhaps one of you takes the black keys and the other takes the white keys.

Tap to continue.

When you can both do sparks, try adding some flames into the mix. To play a flame, just find any two keys with one white key between them, and play them back and forth, over and over. 

Play a game where if one of you plays a spark, the other should respond with a flame near that same place. If you lose track of the last spark your partner did, just wait for the next one. 

You can try to catch each other out, but don’t try to win. Just have fun and work together. Try and keep the music going without stopping.

When you’re happy with how sparks and flames work, tap ‘Next’.

Finally, flames can become a blaze. 

Starting from the middle of the keyboard, find two keys that have one key between them, like a flame. Put one finger from your hand on the left key, and your adult should put one finger from their hand, on the right key.
[Click to continue->]
Play the two keys like a flame, then, move both of your hands one key outwards, so there’s now a gap of three notes in between. Play them back and forth, as a trill. Then, move outwards again. How big can you make the blaze? 

Play with the sparks and the flames, then, when the fire feels very big, both of you should make a blaze together. When you feel you can make all three sound different from each other, tap ‘Next’.

Finally, imagine you’re making a film about a fire, from the first spark, to the ashes it leaves behind. The things that you’re pointing your imaginary camera at are the things your audience hears in the music. The sparks, the flames, and the blaze.
Talk out loud about the story of the fire, so that you can create this piece together. Describe what you’re pointing the camera at, and make it happen in the music. Try directing each other.
Bring the piece to a close, by finding a way to show the heat and light fading. What do ashes sound like?
