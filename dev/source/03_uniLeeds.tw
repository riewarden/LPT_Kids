Hello, and welcome to The University Of Leeds. To start with, please play the following test keys, in any order, to ensure the piano is working.

You might be totally fine with sitting at a piano. Or, perhaps, you are sitting here with a few worries in the back of your. Are you worried that you can’t do this, because you’re not creative enough? That it won’t sound good?

Right now, our world values products over people, and so we often feel guilty if we create anything that isn’t immediately perfect. However, creativity requires us to make mistakes. So, today, I invite you to play, and deliberately sound bad. And I think you’re going to do great.

But you have to believe it too, and to do so, you must change the way you define ‘mistakes’. Be kinder to yourself. If you only play one key, celebrate that. Acknowledge that you’re scared of being creative, because that’s the only way to overcome it.

Let’s start with something simple. Please play the following keys, pausing at the end of each line. The picture below shows you where the keys are. (They’re the same ones you played in the test sequence, a minute ago, so you’re halfway there.) 

If you’d like to hear it played, use the audio player below, or click here to watch a Youtube video. This is a few notes from ‘The Blue Danube’, by Johann Strauss.

Now, it’s time to make this lovely little pattern sound terrible. If you touch the piano keys very lightly, you can be very quiet. If doing that lets you play a little more freely, then go for it.

Try playing the Blue Danube pattern with completely the wrong keys, but in a way where it’s still recognisably the same pattern. It might take a bit of time, experimentally plinking and plonking, to get there, but keep at it. 

Can you do a version that uses keys that are as far apart as possible? Can you do a version that almost sounds like a joke, with a set-up and punchline? How about using your elbow, or the back of your hand to play?

Once you’ve found as many versions as you have the patience for, click next.

Finally, using all the experimentation you’ve just done, try to come up with a sequel, or second part, to the Blue Danube pattern. Perhaps, even go back to the original version that you copied…

…Think about what, if someone else was playing, you might expect them to play after it. Don’t think too hard about the why, just do what feels right. Play the ‘wrong’ version of the pattern, and follow it with a ‘wrong’ sequel.

Can you make a third part that follows the sequel? There’s no need to remember all the notes you’re using. Just keep going, think about the last part you played, and discover the next part, as you go.

Find a way to bring the piece to a close. Take a moment to think about what you created. Is there a way to apply this process to a different creative pursuit?
