!Welcome to Trinity Shopping Centre! 
The next couple of exercises will get you playing the piano for the first time. You can do these exercises by yourself, or with a friend. At the end, you can share your creation using #LeedsPianoTrail2021

Before we begin, we need to check to make sure the piano is working. 
Please play the following two test keys in any order, preferably several times over.

All of the keyboard diagrams start with C. This is the flat, white key just before any two raised black keys. The white keys that follow C progress alphabetically until G, then start again from A.

Once you’re satisfied that all the keys are working, move to the next section.

!What is rhythm?
Rhythm is often understood as a regular, repeated pattern of sound. But, it doesn’t have to sound the same, over and over. Make it up as you go! Put your fingers on these two keys, and play them at the same time.

Now, find lots of different rhythms and beats, just playing these two keys over and over. Try not to keep it the same for too long. Imagine you have to do a whole song, with just these two keys, over and over. How are you going to stop yourself falling asleep? How can you surprise yourself?

Once you’ve had enough of that, move to the next section to add some more notes! Don’t worry, you won’t have to play anything with both hands at the same time. (Unless you want to.)

!Now it’s time to spice things up. 
Take some time to find these keys, with your right hand:

Play them, and see how they sound. Start by playing them in order, from left to right. Then, play them again, but play each note twice before moving on. 

!!Once you’re happy doing that...
Try blending the 'going-up-and-down', with the 'playing-them-twice'.

Keep experimenting with the notes. Just play the next key that you feel makes sense to play. Don’t plan a tune in advance. Limit your focus to these three keys, and the next note.

When you’re happy with how these notes work together, move to the next section.

!Where do these notes come from?
Side note: These notes are adapted from Blues music, which is believed to have derived from West African musical traditions of call-and-response. Blues were often sung by trafficked, enslaved African people, while they were being held at plantations. Like Jazz, Blues music has been incredibly influential on contemporary Western music. 

As these exercises are short, and designed to get you playing quickly, the music you’re playing right now isn’t Blues. The most charitable way to describe what you’re playing, is ‘Blues-inspired notes’.

But, understanding where music comes from, and how it is changed, and subverted by people, over time, allows us to admire and value the way marginalised people have shaped popular music, and avoid claiming, or colonising traditions that don’t belong to us.

Tap the arrow at the top of the page to access the menu, and the 'Credits' page, where you can read more about how the actual Blues are played. Or, do it at the end of the tutorial.

!You're going to use everything we’ve done so far to make your own music. 
Using the keys in your left hand:

And, the keys in your right hand:

<img src="img/C4_Eb4_F4.png" width="90%" alt="Two sets of C and F keys are highlighted, following each other. The E Flat key is also highlighted, which is the raised black key before E.">

Remember, there’s no need to try and play with both hands at the same time. Play in the way that is easiest, and most fun, for you.

Start by making some rhythms with your left hand, then follow them with some melodies on your right hand, before going back to your left hand to do some more rhythms. Play for as long as you like. Don't think too much about the next note, just let it happen.

Then, find a way to bring the piece to a close.
