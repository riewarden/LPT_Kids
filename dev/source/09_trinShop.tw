The next couple of exercises will get you playing the piano for the first time. You can do these exercises by yourself, or with a friend. At the end, you can share your creation using #LeedsPianoTrail2021

Before we begin, we need to check to make sure the piano is working. 
Please play the following five test keys in any order, preferably several times over:

Once you’re satisfied that all the keys are working, tap ‘Next’.

Rhythm is often understood as a regular, repeated pattern of sound. But, it doesn’t have to sound the same, over and over. Make it up as you go! Put your fingers on these two keys, and play them at the same time.

<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>Now, find lots of different rhythms and beats, just playing these two keys over and over. Try not to keep it the same for too long. Imagine you have to do a whole song, with just these two keys, over and over. How are you going to stop yourself falling asleep? How can you surprise yourself?

Once you’ve had enough of that, tap ‘Next’ to add some more notes! Don’t worry, you won’t have to play anything with both hands at the same time. (Unless you want to.)

Great. Now it’s time to spice things up. Put your right hand on these keys:

Now, play them, and see how they sound. Start by playing them in order, from left to right. Then, play them again, but play each note twice before moving on. 

Once you’re happy doing that, try blending the 'going-up-and-down', with the 'playing-them-twice'.
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>
Keep experimenting with the notes. Just play the next key that you feel makes sense to play. Don’t plan a tune in advance. Limit your focus to these three keys, and the next note.

When you’re happy with how these notes work together, you can probably guess what’s next.

Side note: 

These notes are adapted from Blues music, which is believed to have derived from African musical traditions of call-and-response. Blues were often sung sung by trafficked, enslaved African people, while they were being held at plantations. Like Jazz, Blues music has been incredibly influential on contemporary Western music. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>
As these exercises are short, and designed to get you playing quickly, the music you’re playing right now isn’t Blues. The most charitable way to describe what you’re playing, is ‘Blues-inspired notes’.
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>
But, understanding where music comes from, and how it is changed, and subverted by people, over time, allows us to admire and value the way marginalised people have shaped popular music, and avoid claiming, or colonising traditions that don’t belong to us.

Tap the arrow at the top of the page to access the 'Credits' page, where you can read more about how the actual Blues are played. Or, do it at the end of the tutorial.

Using the keys in your left hand:

And, the keys in your right hand:

You're going to use everything we’ve done so far to make your own music. 
<<linkreplace "Tap to continue." t8n>>
Remember, there’s no need to try and play with both hands at the same time. Play in the way that is easiest, and most fun, for you.

Start by making some rhythms with your left hand, then follow them with some melodies on your right hand, before going back to your left hand to do some more rhythms. Don't think too much about the next note, just let it happen.

Then, find a way to bring the piece to a close.
