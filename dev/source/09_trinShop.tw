Hello. Welcome to Trinity Shopping Centre! The next couple of exercises will get you playing the piano for the first time. You can do these exercises by yourself, or with a friend. At the end, you can share your creation using #LeedsPianoTrail2021

Before we begin, we need to check to make sure the piano is working. If it isn’t, [[tap here to contact a member of staff|dave.cartwright@leedspiano.com]].
Please play the following five test keys in any order, preferably several times over:

Once you’re satisfied all the keys are working, tap ‘Next’.

Rhythm is often understood as a regular, repeated pattern of sound. But, doesn’t have to sound the same, over and over. Make it up as you go! Put your fingers on these two keys, and play them at the same time.

Now, find lots of different rhythms and beats, just playing these two keys over and over. Try not to keep it the same for too long. Imagine you have to do a whole song, with just these two keys, over and over. How are you going to stop yourself falling asleep? How can you surprise yourself?

Once you’ve had enough of that, tap ‘Next’ to add some more notes! Don’t worry, you won’t have to play anything with both hands at the same time (unless you want to.)

Great. Now it’s time to spice things up. Now, put your right hand on these keys:

Now, play with the new keys on your right hand, and see how they sound. Start by playing them in order, from left to right. Then, play them again, but play each note twice before moving on. Once you’re happy doing that, try blending the going-up-and-down, with the playing-them-twice.

Keep experimenting with the notes. Just play the next key that you feel makes sense to play. Don’t plan a tune in advance. Just limit your focus to these three keys, and the next note.

When you’re happy with how the notes work together, you can probably guess what’s next.

These notes are adapted from, Blues music, which is believed to have derived from African musical traditions of call-and-response. Blues music was often sung on plantations by enslaved West African people. Like Jazz, Blues have been incredibly influential on contemporary Western music. 
The music you’re playing right now isn’t Blues. Frankly, the most charitable way to describe what you’re playing, is that ‘the notes are Blues-inspired’.
But, understanding where music comes from, and how it is changed, and subverted by people, over time, allows us to admire and value the way marginalised people have shaped popular music, and avoid claiming, or colonising traditions that don’t belong to us.

Using the keys in your left hand:

And, the keys in your right hand:

Use everything we’ve done so far to make your own music. Remember, there’s no need to try and play with both hands at the same time. Play in the way that is easiest, and most fun, for you.
Start by making some rhythms with your left hand, then follow them with some melodies on your right hand, before going back to your left hand to do some more rhythms. 

If you’re having a good time, why not record some of your experiments, and share them, using the hashtag #LeedsPianoTrail2021 !
If you enjoyed this activity, there’s plenty to get involved with on [[the rest of The Leeds Piano Trail.|TrinEnd]]
