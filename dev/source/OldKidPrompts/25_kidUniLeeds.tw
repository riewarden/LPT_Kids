You might be totally fine with sitting at a piano. Or, perhaps, you are sitting here with a few worries in the back of your mind. You might want to immediately play something amazing, that everyone thinks is brilliant! 
That’s a big goal, and that’s great. But, a big part of being creative is trying stuff, even if you aren’t sure if it’s going to work. Sometimes, it feels awful when we make something, and it doesn’t work. But, those times are worth it for the times when we take a chance, and discover something beautiful.
To start with, look back at these keys.
Then, play the following sequence, pausing at the end of each line. This is a few notes from ‘The Blue Danube’, by Johann Strauss.

If you’d like to hear it played, use the audio player below.
One of you should start by playing the pattern in one place on the piano. Then, the other player should play the same pattern in a different place on the piano. Do that over and over, until you’re both comfortable playing it.

Once you’re comfortable with playing this pattern, tap ‘Next’.

Now, it’s time to make this lovely little pattern sound terrible! If you touch the piano keys very lightly, you can be very quiet. If doing that lets you play a little more freely, then go for it.

Take it in turns to play the ‘Blue Danube’ pattern with completely the wrong keys. Try to play it in a way where it’s wrong, but still recognisable. It might take a bit of time, plinking and plonking, to get there, but keep at it. As you go back and forth, try to make the next version sillier than the last.

Can you do a version that uses keys that are as far apart as possible? Can you do a version that sounds like a joke, with a set-up and punchline? How about using your elbow, or the back of your hand to play?

Once you’ve found as many versions as you have the patience for, click next.

Finally, using all the experimentation you’ve just done, try to turn the ‘Blue Danube’ pattern into an entire song. Go back to the original version that you copied…

…One of you should play it again. Then, the next player should listen, and respond by playing a ‘wrong’ tune that is slightly different. Be inspired by all the variations you just created. Don’t think too hard about //why// you’re playing something. Play the ‘wrong’ version of the pattern, and follow it with a ‘wrong’ sequel. Listen, and respond, and keep the tune going for as long as you can.
