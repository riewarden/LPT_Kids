!Welcome to the Merrion Rest Gardens.
Before we begin, please play any of the highlighted test keys, in any order, to ensure the piano is working. 

All of the keyboard images start with C. This is the flat, white key just before any two raised black keys. The white keys that follow C progress alphabetically until G, then start again from A.

!A useful skill for music-making is being able to listen to the other sounds around you
This helps you make a decision about what sounds you’d like to add to them.

Nearby, there is a sculpture, by Pianodrome, called Deep Listening, which has a cast-iron frame, that you can strike with a beater. Go over and play it, or wait for someone else to. Then, just listen to the sounds it can make. 

When a sound starts to fade away, try to pinpoint the moment it turns from vibrations in the air, to stillness. How do these sounds blend with the other sounds, in and around the Rest Gardens? 

Imagine the sound as ripples of water, moving outwards, and colliding with whatever they hit.

Go nice and slowly, and take at least three minutes to do this, then ask yourself the following questions:

!How do we describe the sound?
!!Duration
How long can the sound last? How short? How quickly can it make another sound? Does it need time to rest?
!!Timbre
If this sound was a colour, or a shape, what would it look like? Does this sound have emotions? What makes this sound’s shape different to the piano’s shape?
!!Pitch
Is this a high, or a low sound? If you hum the sound, is it easy for you to reach, or is it a strain?

!What other questions could you ask about the sound? 
Are there any questions you can’t find the answer to? Is it because no answer exists, or would you find it by asking someone else?

!Now, go back to the piano. 
If you were playing the sculpture yourself, give the iron one last hit, and make a note that’s going to last a little while. If you were letting other people play, wait for someone to play another note.

When you’re back at the piano, listen to the iron note, and try and find a note on it that you think works well with the iron note. 

!Search for the note very slowly. 
It could be the same note, it could be a contrasting note, or something else entirely. 

If you play some notes that don’t sound like what you wanted, that’s great. The journey to finding the note you want is now going to be part of this composition that’s emerging, as you go along.

WWhen you find a note that you like, look for another, and a third. Try playing some at the same time. Try playing them in sequences. If people come up to the sculpture to strike it, respond to the notes they create.

Find a time to come gently to a stop.
