If you're reading this, Laurie has suffered a terrible fate and now cannot finish developing the app for The Leeds International Piano Competition. Or, you're interested to know how I made it.

I developed the app using a framework called Twine 2, which is used to make interactive text adventures that can be played through a web browser. If you don't know anything about web development, don't bother reading the rest of this.

Twine 2 has a visual interface, designed for beginners, but you can also write in its source code, Twee3. There are several different ways to write Twine 2 stories, known as Story Formats. I used SugarCube, because it has the most flexibility and customisation, especially with regards to javascript functionality. I also used TweeGo, which compiles multiple .tw files into one HTML file, and enables you to organise projects a lot more efficiently, and code with an text editor like Sublime Text, or VSCode (what I used).

/dev contains incomplete build files. /root is where complete builds should be placed, when TweeGo compiles a HTML file. The github repo with recent build and updates is here:

All my notes that I've collected on developing with Twee3, TweeGo, Sugarcube and Twine 2, are collected here. If you have a leedspiano email address, you should be able to access it:

10.08.21: Piano keyboard files created and optimised with optipng.

06.08.21: At the moment, I've done a lot of the hard work, which was writing the prompts, and now they just need to be implemented in Twee3/Sugarcube.
